= Gitt

Provides a monadic Object API to the {git_link} CLI. This project is also an extraction of work originally implemented within the following projects:

* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/git-lint[Git Lint]
* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/milestoner[Milestoner]
* link:https://alchemists.io/projects/rubysmith[Rubysmith]

This project doesn't try to encompass the vast feature set natively provided by {git_link} but only exposes the most used features, limited as this may be. Over time, more of the {git_link} feature set will be implemented but it'll most likely happen slowly and organically. If you are looking for alternatives to this gem, then you might find the following of interest:

== Features

* Wraps a subset of native {git_link} commands with additional enhancements to improve your working experience.
* Answers link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads[monads] you can pipe together -- or link:https://alchemists.io/projects/transactable[transact] -- for more powerful and complex workflows.
* Provides _optional_ {rspec_link} shared contexts that speed up the testing of your own Git related implementations.

== Setup

To set up the project, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/setup
----

== Usage

At a high level, this project provides a centralized Object API via a single object: `Repository`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
git = Gitt::Repository.new

git.branch          # Equivalent to `git branch <arguments>`.
git.branch_default  # Answers default branch.
git.branch_name     # Answers current branch.
git.call            # Allows you to run any Git command.
git.commits         # Answers commit records.
git.config          # Equivalent to `git config <arguments>`.
git.exist?          # Answers if current directory is a Git repository or not.
git.get             # Equivalent to `git config get`.
git.log             # Equivalent to `git log <arguments>`.
git.origin?         # Answers if repository has an origin or not.
git.set             # Equivalent to `get config set`.
git.tag             # Equivalent to `git tag <arguments>`.
git.tag?            # Answers if local or remote tag exists.
git.tag_create      # Create a new tag.
git.tag_last        # Answers last tag created.
git.tag_local?      # Answers if local tag exists?
git.tag_parse       # Parses and answers a tag record.
git.tag_remote?     # Answers if remote tag exists?
git.tagged?         # Answers if the repository has any tags.
git.tags_push       # Pushes local tags to remote git.
git.uncommitted     # Parses a file and answers an unsaved commit message.
----

=== Commands

Should you want to use individual commands instead of interacting with the `Repository` object, you
can leverage any of the objects in the `Commands` namespace which -- at a minimum -- use the link:https://alchemists.io/articles/interactor_pattern[Command Pattern]. Here are the specific commands which are enhanced further:

==== link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch[Branch]

Handles branches.

[source,ruby]
----
branch = Gitt::Commands::Branch.new

# Answers branch default (via Git `init.defaultBranch` configuration) of if blank.
branch.default  # Success "main"

# Answers branch default fallback if unset or error is detected.
branch.default "source"  # Success "source"

# Accepts any argument you'd send to `git branch`. Example:
branch.call "--list"  # Success "  main\n"

# Answers current branch
branch.name  # Success "major"
----

==== link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config[Config]

Handles global and local configurations.

[source,ruby]
----
config = Gitt::Commands::Config.new

# Accepts any argument you'd send to `git config`. Example:
config.call "--get", "rebase.abbreviateCommands"  # Success "true\n"

# Answers value for key with support for fallback value or block manipulation.
config.get "user.name"                                     # Success "Brooke Kuhlmann"
config.get "user.unknown", "fallback"                      # Success "fallback"
config.get("user.unknown") { |value| value + "fallback" }  # "fallback"

# Answers true or false if origin is defined.
config.origin?                                             # true

# Sets configuration key and value.
config.set "user.demo", "test"                             # Success "test"
----

==== link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log[Log]

Handles commit history.

[source,ruby]
----
log = Gitt::Commands::Log.new

log.call "--oneline", "-1"  # Success "5e21a9866827 Added documentation\n"
----

The `Log` class provides two other methods but they require a more detailed explanation. The first is `Log#all` which answers an array of commits (records) upon success and accepts the same arguments as given to `#call`.

[source,ruby]
----
commit = log.all
----

The second, is:

[source,ruby]
----
commit log.uncommitted ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG"
----

The above will answer a single commit record. This is great for building a commit object from an unsaved commit message. The only disadvantage of this approach is that you will get template commits which are always stripped out by Git when processing a _saved_ commit.

==== link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag[Tag]

Handles the tagging/versioning of commits.

[source,ruby]
----
tag = Gitt::Commands::Tag.new

# Accepts any argument you'd send to `git tag`.
# Example: tag.call "--list"
stdout, stderr, status = tag.call

# Answers true or false base on whether local and remote tag exist.
tag.exist? "0.1.0"

# Answers last tag for git.
tag.last

# Answers if local tag exists.
tag.local? "0.1.0"

# Pushes tags to remote git.
tag.push

# Answers if remote tag exists.
tag.remote? "0.1.0"

# Answers true or false based on whether repository is tagged.
tag.tagged?
----

=== Models

In order to have access to rich data from the Git client, there are several models available to you.

==== Commit

An instance of `Gitt::Models::Commit` is what is answered back to when using `Gitt::Repository` via the `#commits` or `#uncommitted` methods. In each case, you'll either get an array of records, a single record, or a failure depending on the result. Here's an example of a single record:

[source,ruby]
----
# #<struct Gitt::Models::Commit
#  author_date_relative="2 days ago",
#  author_email="demo@example.com",
#  author_name="Demo User",
#  body="Necessary to explain recent changes.\n",
#  body_lines=["Necessary to explain recent changes."],
#  body_paragraphs=["Necessary to explain recent changes."],
#  message="Updated documentation with new functionality\n\nNecessary to explain recent changes.\n",
#  sha="5e21a9866827bf5c68bd445ea01b3837a3936b45",
#  subject="Updated documentation with new functionality",
#  trailers=[],
#  trailers_index=nil>
----

You get a {struct_link} with the following attributes:

* `author_date_relative`: Stores the relative date of when the commit was made.
* `author_email`: Stores the author email.
* `author_name`: Stores the author name.
* `body`: Stores the commit body which excludes the subject and leading space.
* `body_lines`: Stores each line of the body in an array.
* `body_paragraphs`: Stores each paragraph of the body as an array (i.e. broken by double new lines).
* `message`: Stores the entire, raw, commit message (i.e. subject and body).
* `sha`: Stores the commit SHA.
* `subject`: Stores the commit subject.
* `trailers`: Stores any commit trailers as an array of `Gitt::Models::Trailer` records.
* `trailers_index`: Stores the starting index of trailers within the commit message.

==== Tag

An instance of `Gitt::Models::Tag` is what is answered back to when using `Gitt::Repository` via the `#tag_parse` method. Here's an example:

[source,ruby]
----
# #<struct Gitt::Models::Tag
#  author_date="Tue Dec 29 17:33:01 2020 -0700",
#  author_email="demo@example.com",
#  author_name="Demo User",
#  body="- Added gem skeleton\n- Added RSpec dependency",
#  sha="d041d07c29f97b5b06b3b2fd05fa1dd018c7da7c",
#  subject="Version 0.1.0",
#  version="0.1.0">
----

You get a {struct_link} with the following attributes:

*  `author_date`: Stores author creation date.
*  `author_email`: Stores author email.
*  `author_name`: Store author name.
*  `body`: Stores body of tag which can be sentences, multiple paragraphs, and/or signature information.
*  `sha`: Stores the commit SHA for which this tag labels
*  `subject`: Stores the subject.
*  `version`: Stores the version.

==== Trailer

A trailer is nested within a commit record when trailer information exists. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
#<struct Gitt::Models::Trailer key="Issue", delimiter=":", space=" ", value="123">
----

The attributes break down as follows:

* `key`: Answers the key.
* `delimiter`: Answers the delimiter which must be a colon but can be missing if invalid.
* `space`: Answers either a space or an empty string with the former being invalid.
* `value`: Answers the value associated with the key.

=== RSpec

For fans of {rspec_link}, this gem provides shared contexts you can use within your own test suites. These shared contexts are _optional_, not required for you by default, and must be manually required to use.

==== Git Commit

Provides a default `git_commit` record of `Gitt::Models::Commit` with minimal information for testing purposes and can be used as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
require "gitt/rspec/shared_contexts/git_commit"

describe Demo do
  include_context "with Git commit"
end
----

==== Git Repository

Provides a simple Git repository with a single commit for testing purposes. This repository is set up and torn down _around_ each spec. The repository is built within your project's `tmp` directory and provides a `git_repo_dir` pathname you can interact with. Here's how to use it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "gitt/rspec/shared_contexts/git_repo"
require "refinements/pathname"

describe Demo do
  include_context "with Git repository"

  using Refinements::Pathname

  it "is a demo" do
    git_repo_dir.change_dir { # Your expectation goes here. }
  end
end
----

==== Temporary Directory

Provides a temporary directory (i.e. `tmp/rspec`) for creating directories and or files you want set up and torn down _around_ each spec. Access to the `temp_dir` pathname is also provided for you. Here's how to use it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "gitt/rspec/shared_contexts/temp_dir"
require "refinements/pathname"

describe Demo do
  include_context "with temporary directory"

  using Refinements::Pathname

  it "is a demo" do
    temp_dir.change_dir { # Your expectation goes here. }
  end
end
----

💡 The Git Repository shared context -- mentioned above -- includes this shared context by default so you don't have to manually include this shared context when using the Git Repository shared context.
